Introduction to machine learning in Python:
Machine learning is one of the hottest new technologies to emerge in the last decade, transforming fields from consumer electronics and healthcare to retail. This has led to intense curiosity about the industry among many students and working professionals.

study Python machine learning:
1.Python-based: Python is one of the most commonly used languages to build machine learning systems. Most of the resources in this learning path are drawn from top-notch Python conferences such as PyData and PyCon, and created by highly regarded data scientists.
2.Hands-on material: Many of the materials we have included are hands-on tutorials that come with code and real-world data sets that’ll help you get a practical understanding of the techniques we’ll cover.

What will you learn?
1.The most common supervised learning and unsupervised learning algorithms, from linear regression to logistic regression to k-means clustering to random forest and other decision tree techniques.

2.How to use Pandas and NumPy to accomplish various data mining and data wrangling tasks to turn your data into useable training data.

3.How to use scikit-learn, a powerful tool, to comb over your available data and implement practical machine learning techniques.

4.How to use computer science techniques to build the foundation of artificial intelligence, big data, and predictive models.

5.How to build basic deep neural networks that represent the cutting-edge when it comes to reinforcement learning and deep learning in machines.

Who is this for?

You’re comfortable programming in at least one language and curious about transitioning to data science. In particular, you want to have a strong understanding of what machine learning is, what the different techniques are, and what machine learning can actually do. You want to understand how to work with this new technology with a free machine learning python tutorial.
